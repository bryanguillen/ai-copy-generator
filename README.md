# AI Copy Generator

A simple AI copy generator built with Next.js, OpenAI, and Tailwind CSS. The main theme with this project was to keep things simple; this includes the implementation and the user experience. **This was all done in an effort to get comfortable working with AI and building an actual product with it.**
